# Genetic Drawing
This is a refactor of https://github.com/anopara/genetic-drawing

@anopara inspired me to refactor this project and 
include some new operators to the genetic algorithm.


## Python
There is a Conda environment included with this project.
Just do
```
conda env create -n genetic-drawning -f conda-environment.yml
conda active genetic-drawning
```

Or install these Python 3 libraries:

* opencv 3.4.1
* numpy 1.16.2
* matplotlib 3.0.3
* Jupyter 
* and Jupyter Notebook

To start, open the GeneticDrawing.ipynb and run the example code
