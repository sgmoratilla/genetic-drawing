# Genetic Drawing
This is a refactor of https://github.com/anopara/genetic-drawing

@anopara inspired me to refactor this project and 
include some new operators to the genetic algorithm.


## Python
There is a Conda environment included with this project.
Just do
```
conda env create -n genetic-drawning -f conda-environment.yml
conda activate genetic-drawning
```

To start, open the GeneticDrawing.ipynb and run the example code
